    "## Installation\n",
    "Before opening and running the files in this folder, please be aware that setting up your `path` name in every file is necessary in order for it to fully run. Here is a demonstration:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Set the path to the directory containing the dataset \n",
    "path = r\"Your Pathname\" \n",
    "\n",
    "# Change the current working directory to the specified path\n",
    "os.chdir(path)\n",
    "\n",
    "# List files in the 'car' subdirectory to verify the presence of the dataset\n",
    "os.listdir(os.path.join('car'))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Construct the file path for the car prices dataset\n",
    "car_path = os.path.join(\"car\" , \"car_prices.csv\")\n",
    "# Load the dataset from the specified path into a pandas DataFrame\n",
    "# 'on_bad_lines=\"skip\"' is used to handle any problematic lines during loading\n",
    "car_df = pd.read_csv(car_path, on_bad_lines=\"skip\")\n",
    "# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame for a preliminary look at the data\n",
    "car_df.head()\n",

    "Also make sure you have the right name for your subdirectory file. In this case it is car, but it can be different for you.\n",

    "This project harnesses `advanced predictive modeling to revolutionize decision-making in car dealerships`, focusing on enhancing inventory selection and pricing strategies. `The goal` is to leverage data-driven insights for boosting profitability in the competitive automotive market.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "- Implement predictive models for accurate car price prediction.\n",
    "- Analyze the impact of car features on selling prices to optimize inventory.\n",
    "- Develop dynamic pricing strategies based on market trends and car characteristics.\n",
    "- Enhance customer experience and resource allocation efficiency through data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "    - Gathered and cleansed data on used car auction prices and relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Development\n",
    "    - Developed and compared various models: Random Forest, Neural Networks, KNN, XGBoost, and Linear Regression.\n",
    "    - Trained and tested these models on different feature subsets to evaluate their price prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Techniques and Concepts\n",
    "    - **Feature Analysis**: Investigating how features like body type, color, region, and MMR data affect car prices.\n",
    "    - **Predictive Analytics**: Using machine learning to forecast car selling prices and identify profitable inventory.\n",
    "    - **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjusting pricing in response to market trends and vehicle specifics.\n",
    "    - **Risk Assessment**: Identifying and mitigating potential inventory risks.\n",
    "\n",
